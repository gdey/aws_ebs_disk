When submitting a pull request, please do not modify the version number. I will
update the version number as need, after merging in pull requests.

If a contribution adds new platforms or platform versions, indicate such in the 
body of the commit message(s), and in the pull request. When writing commit 
messages, it is helpful for others if you indicate the GitHub issue/pull request
number.

    git commit -m '[issues/1] Updated pool resource to correctly delete.'

In the ticket itself, it is also helpful if you include log output of
a successful Chef run, but this is not absolutely required.
